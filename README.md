# git_test
First active GitHub repo!

I want this to be a repository to track my progress I have been working on some projects for sometime now.I'm going to publish more repos with actual coded projects that I have been working on as of late.
Some of my main goals right now is to learn git and to publish more repositories. I want to network with more developers while building a portfolio as I become more job ready. There is a lot to learn so getting feedback and knowledge from more experienced developers will be helpful my learning journey. So far all of these updated repositories have been made within the same day which is why they are grouped together.

At the start of my coding journey I read and watched content on how git was an important feature
when learning to code. However I did not anticipate the importance of github or
the networking side in general now that I have a basic understanding of git I think I will be able to
progress more. To clarify this git test is only me learning github currently I got stuck on how 
to push repositories to the main branch. Only to find out the reason I couldn't commit and push was
because I did not save my repository. Still getting confused red means bad right??????
