# git_test
First active GitHub repo!

I want this to be a repository to track my progress I have been working on some projects for sometime now.I'm going to publish more repos with actual coded projects that I have been working on as of late.
Some of my main goals right now is to learn git and to publish more repositories. I want to network with more developers while building a portfolio as I become more job ready. There is a lot to learn so getting feedback and knowledge from more experienced developers will be helpful my learning journey. So far all of these updated repositories have been made within the same day which is why they are grouped together.
